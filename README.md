# Comparing Global and Local Annual Temperatures 

This is the landing page showcasing a simple SQL project I conducted as part of my completion of the 4-month "Programming for Data Science with Python" nanodegree - an online coding bootcamp by Udacity. In this project, I authored a SQL code to extract data from Udacity's web-based copy of the PostgreSQL sample database, [Sakila](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/), which contains data from a DVD rental company.
